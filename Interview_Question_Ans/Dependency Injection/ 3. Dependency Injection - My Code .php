1. create a interface with function . 
2. create another class that implement the interface class for access the function 



1. Interface :
 ------------
  Interface PaymentInterface {

  // interface : child class must be implemented all the interface function. inherited by multiple time. 
  // abstruction : child class partially implemented the base class function. inherited by one time.  
  //in interface or abstruction only define the function not implement full code : 

  public function paymentProcess(); 

}

2. Implement or extends 
------------------------
Class Bkash impletemnt PaymentInterface {

  public function processPayment($amount){

  echo " Your Bkash amount is : $amount";
  }

}



3. **** Main part: 
--------------------

Class PaymentController {

  private $paymentGateway; 

  function __controller (PaymentInterface $payment){

    $this->paymentGateway = $payment; 
    
  }

public function processPayment($amount){

  $this->paymentGateway->processPayment($amount)
}

}

4. call: 
-----------
# create obj from 2. 
# create interface obj from 1. 
# interface Obj pass ($params to class ways function. )

You're on the right track with your example! Let me complete it and correct a few issues to show how dependency injection works in Laravel:

```php
<?php

// 1. Create the interface with function
// app/Interfaces/PaymentInterface.php
namespace App\Interfaces;

interface PaymentInterface 
{
    // In interface, only define the function without implementation
    public function processPayment($amount);
}

// 2. Create classes that implement the interface
// app/Services/Bkash.php
namespace App\Services;

use App\Interfaces\PaymentInterface;

class Bkash implements PaymentInterface 
{
    public function processPayment($amount)
    {
        return "Your Bkash payment of $amount has been processed successfully.";
    }
}

// app/Services/Stripe.php
namespace App\Services;

use App\Interfaces\PaymentInterface;

class Stripe implements PaymentInterface 
{
    public function processPayment($amount)
    {
        return "Your Stripe payment of $amount has been processed successfully.";
    }
}

// 3. Create the controller that uses dependency injection
// app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Interfaces\PaymentInterface;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class PaymentController extends Controller 
{
    private $paymentGateway;
    
    // Constructor injection - Laravel will automatically inject the bound implementation
    public function __construct(PaymentInterface $payment)
    {
        $this->paymentGateway = $payment;
    }
    
    public function processPayment(Request $request)
    {
        $amount = $request->input('amount');
        $result = $this->paymentGateway->processPayment($amount);
        
        return view('payment.confirmation', ['message' => $result]);
    }
}

// 4. Register bindings in a service provider
// app/Providers/PaymentServiceProvider.php
namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use App\Interfaces\PaymentInterface;
use App\Services\Bkash;
use App\Services\Stripe;

class PaymentServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        // Bind the interface to a specific implementation
        $this->app->bind(PaymentInterface::class, function ($app) {
            // You could use configuration to determine which payment gateway to use
            $paymentMethod = config('payment.default', 'bkash');
            
            if ($paymentMethod == 'stripe') {
                return new Stripe();
            }
            
            return new Bkash();
        });
    }
}
```

Now, register the service provider in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    // Other providers...
    App\Providers\PaymentServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Create a config file `config/payment.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    'default' => env('PAYMENT_METHOD', 'bkash'),
];
```

And finally, add routes in `routes/web.php`:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\PaymentController;

Route::post('/payment/process', [PaymentController::class, 'processPayment']);
```

Now, to use it from the browser or client side:

```html
<!-- resources/views/payment/form.blade.php -->
<form action="/payment/process" method="POST">
    @csrf
    <input type="number" name="amount" placeholder="Amount">
    <button type="submit">Process Payment</button>
</form>
```

The key advantages of this approach:
1. Your `PaymentController` doesn't need to know which payment gateway is being used
2. You can switch between Bkash and Stripe by just changing the config value
3. When testing, you can mock the `PaymentInterface` to test your controller without making real payment calls

This is the essence of dependency injection in Laravel - decoupling components through interfaces and letting the framework handle the instantiation and injection of the appropriate implementation.
