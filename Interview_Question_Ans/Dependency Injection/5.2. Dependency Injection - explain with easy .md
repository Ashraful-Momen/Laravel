Easy-English explanation  
========================

Imagine you are building a toy car.

**Old way (no Dependency Injection)**  
You open the box, **you yourself** must make the engine, the wheels, the battery.  
Your car class looks like:

```php
class Car {
    private $engine;
    public function __construct() {
        $this->engine = new Engine();   // you build it
    }
}
```

Problems:  
- Lots of work for you.  
- Hard to change the engine later.  
- Difficult to test—real engine always runs.

**New way (with Dependency Injection)**  
You simply **ask for** a ready engine.  
Someone else (Laravel’s container) gives it to you.

```php
class Car {
    private $engine;
    public function __construct(Engine $engine) { // just ask
        $this->engine = $engine;
    }
}
```

Laravel sees “ah, Car needs an Engine” → container hands one in.  
You do **zero** building.

**Key points in kid-friendly words**  
1. You **don’t make** your tools; you **receive** them.  
2. The container is the friendly helper that passes the tools.  
3. If many cars need the same engine, the helper gives the **same** one (singleton).  
4. Changing the engine later means only changing the helper’s shelf, not every car.

That’s all Dependency Injection is:  
**“Don’t build it yourself—just ask, and Laravel will hand it to you.”**
