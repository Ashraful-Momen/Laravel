I'll create a complete, step-by-step guide to understand Laravel's Facade pattern using a Calculator example. This will cover everything from creating the service to understanding how Laravel resolves it.Now let me create a visual diagram that shows the complete flow:## Summary: The Complete Facade Concept

Here's what makes Laravel's Facade pattern special:

### 1. **The Facade is just a "phone number"**
```php
class Calculator extends Facade {
    protected static function getFacadeAccessor() {
        return 'calculator';  // This is like a phone number
    }
}
```

### 2. **The Service Provider is the "phone book"**
```php
$this->app->bind('calculator', function() {
    return new Calculator();  // This registers the number
});
```

### 3. **The Container is the "operator"**
When you call `Calculator::add()`, Laravel:
- Asks for the phone number (`getFacadeAccessor`)
- Looks it up in the phone book (Container)
- Connects you to the real service
- Executes your method

### 4. **The Magic Method is the "switchboard"**
`__callStatic` intercepts all calls and routes them properly.

## Quick Test to Prove It Works

```php
// In tinker or a route:
Calculator::add(10, 5);           // Returns: 15
app('calculator')->add(10, 5);    // Same thing! Returns: 15

// They're the same object:
app('calculator') === app('calculator');  // true (if singleton)
```

The beauty of Facades is that they make your code look clean while maintaining all the benefits of dependency injection and the service container. You get the simplicity of static calls with the power of object-oriented programming!
