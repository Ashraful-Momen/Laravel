We use **Service classes** in Laravel instead of helper functions to keep the code **clean, testable, and maintainable**.

👉 **Helper** = quick utility (global, hard to test).
👉 **Service** = organized business logic (OOP-based, reusable, dependency-injectable).

**Short answer:**

> Services make complex logic modular, testable, and follow SOLID principles — unlike helpers which are global and tightly coupled.
