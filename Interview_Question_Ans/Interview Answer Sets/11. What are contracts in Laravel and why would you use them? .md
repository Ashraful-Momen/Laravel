**Laravel Contracts** are interfaces that define the core services provided by the framework. They live in the `Illuminate\Contracts` namespace.

**Why use them:**

1. **Loose coupling** — You depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations, making your code more flexible and testable.

2. **Easy swapping** — You can swap out implementations without changing your code. For example, swapping a database cache driver for Redis.

3. **Clear contracts** — They document what methods a service should implement, making the API explicit and understandable.

4. **Better testing** — You can easily mock contracts in unit tests instead of mocking concrete classes.

**Example:** Instead of depending on `Illuminate\Cache\Repository` directly, you depend on `Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository`. This way, if Laravel changes the implementation internally, your code still works.

They're essentially a way to program to interfaces rather than implementations, which is a SOLID principle best practice.
