**Tight coupling** means one part of your code **depends too directly on another part**, so changing one will likely **break** the other.

Example 👇
If a controller directly calls a helper or creates objects inside itself — it becomes tightly coupled.
So, if you change that helper’s logic or class name, you must edit the controller too.

✅ **Loose coupling** (using interfaces, services, dependency injection) makes components independent and easier to test or replace without breaking others.
