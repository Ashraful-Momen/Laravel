**Dependency Injection (DI)** in Laravel means **automatically providing the required class or object** to another class instead of creating it manually.

**Short answer (for interview):**

> Dependency Injection is a design pattern where Laravel automatically supplies class dependencies through the constructor or method. It makes code **loosely coupled, testable, and easy to maintain**.

**Example:**

```php
class UserController {
    public function __construct(UserService $service) {
        $this->service = $service; // Laravel injects it automatically
    }
}
```

Here, Laravel’s service container injects `UserService` — you don’t need to create it manually with `new`.
