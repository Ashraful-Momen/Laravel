# Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy in PHP - Simple Guide

## Definition

**Shallow Copy:** Copy an object but properties that use references/pointers still point to the same memory location

**Deep Copy:** Copy object completely including all referenced/nested objects

## Simple Concept

- **Shallow Copy** = Copy the box, but inside objects are still shared
- **Deep Copy** = Copy the box AND everything inside it

## Real-life Analogy
Imagine copying a **house blueprint**:
- **Shallow Copy** = Copy the blueprint, but both blueprints point to the same actual furniture
- **Deep Copy** = Copy the blueprint AND make new furniture for each house

## Code Example

```php
<?php
// Helper class to understand the concept
class Address 
{
    public $street;
    public $city;
    
    public function __construct($street, $city) 
    {
        $this->street = $street;
        $this->city = $city;
    }
    
    public function getFullAddress() 
    {
        return $this->street . ", " . $this->city;
    }
}

class Person 
{
    public $name;
    public $age;
    public $address;    // This is an OBJECT (reference)
    public $hobbies;    // This is an ARRAY
    
    public function __construct($name, $age, Address $address, array $hobbies) 
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
        $this->address = $address;
        $this->hobbies = $hobbies;
    }
    
    public function getInfo() 
    {
        return "{$this->name} ({$this->age}) lives at " . $this->address->getFullAddress() . 
               " and likes: " . implode(", ", $this->hobbies);
    }
}

// Shallow Copy Class (default PHP behavior)
class PersonShallow extends Person 
{
    public function createShallowCopy() 
    {
        return clone $this; // PHP default clone = shallow copy
    }
    
    public function __clone() 
    {
        // Do nothing - this creates shallow copy
    }
}

// Deep Copy Class
class PersonDeep extends Person 
{
    public function createDeepCopy() 
    {
        return clone $this; // Will use our custom __clone method
    }
    
    public function __clone() 
    {
        // Deep copy: clone the address object
        $this->address = clone $this->address;
        
        // Deep copy: create new array (if array had objects, clone those too)
        $this->hobbies = array_merge([], $this->hobbies);
    }
}

echo "After modifying address in shallow copy:\n";
echo "Original: " . $originalPerson->getInfo() . "\n";        // ADDRESS CHANGED!
echo "Shallow Copy: " . $shallowCopy->getInfo() . "\n";

echo "\nðŸš¨ PROBLEM: Original person's address changed too!\n";
echo "Because both objects point to the same Address object in memory\n\n";

echo "Original: " . $originalPerson2->getInfo() . "\n";

// Create deep copy
$deepCopy = $originalPerson2->createDeepCopy();
$deepCopy->name = "Maria Copy";
$deepCopy->age = 35;

echo "After creating deep copy:\n";
echo "Original: " . $originalPerson2->getInfo() . "\n";
echo "Deep Copy: " . $deepCopy->getInfo() . "\n";

echo "\n--- Now let's modify the ADDRESS in deep copy ---\n";

// SOLUTION: Modifying address in copy does NOT affect original!
$deepCopy->address->street = "999 Elm Street";
$deepCopy->hobbies[] = "cooking";

echo "After modifying address in deep copy:\n";
echo "Original: " . $originalPerson2->getInfo() . "\n";      // ADDRESS UNCHANGED!
echo "Deep Copy: " . $deepCopy->getInfo() . "\n";

echo "\nâœ… SUCCESS: Original person's address stays the same!\n";
echo "Because each object has its own Address object in memory\n\n";

## Key Differences

| Shallow Copy | Deep Copy |
|---|---|
| **Fast** - just copies references | **Slower** - creates new objects |
| **Memory efficient** - shares objects | **More memory** - duplicates everything |
| **Dangerous** - changes affect both copies | **Safe** - independent copies |
| **Default PHP behavior** | **Requires custom `__clone` method** |

## When to Use Each

### Use Shallow Copy When:
âœ… Inner objects should be shared  
âœ… Memory is limited  
âœ… Objects are immutable (never change)  
âœ… Performance is critical  

### Use Deep Copy When:
âœ… You need completely independent copies  
âœ… You'll modify nested objects  
âœ… Safety is more important than performance  
âœ… Working with user data/configurations  

## Common Scenarios

**Shallow Copy Example:**
```php
// Configuration objects that should be shared
$config = new DatabaseConfig("localhost", "mydb");
$user1 = new User("John", $config);  // All users share same config
$user2 = clone $user1;               // Should share config
```

**Deep Copy Example:**
```php
// User profiles that should be independent
$address = new Address("123 Main St", "NYC");
$user1 = new User("John", $address);
$user2 = clone $user1;               // Should have own address
```

## Memory Visualization

```
SHALLOW COPY:
Original  â†’ [name: "John"] â†’ Address Object â†’ [street: "Main St"]
                              â†—
Copy      â†’ [name: "Copy"] â†’ â†— (points to same address)

DEEP COPY:
Original â†’ [name: "John"] â†’ Address Object A â†’ [street: "Main St"]

Copy     â†’ [name: "Copy"] â†’ Address Object B â†’ [street: "Main St"]
```

## Bottom Line

- **Shallow Copy** = Copy the container, share the contents
- **Deep Copy** = Copy the container AND the contents
- Choose based on whether you want changes to affect both copies or not!
