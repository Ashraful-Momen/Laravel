Perfect. You want to **mount your Laravel project's `public/` and `storage/` directories to an external S3 bucket** (from another cloud provider) **without changing any application code**.

This is a very common and smart infrastructure decision. The good news is: **this is 100% achievable with Docker Swarm and minimal-to-zero code changes**, as long as your Laravel app already uses Laravel’s `Storage` facade or standard file operations like `file_put_contents`, `copy`, etc., relative to the `storage/` and `public/` paths.

---

## ✅ Goal

- Keep your Laravel code **completely unchanged**.
- Have all files that would normally be written to `/var/www/html/public` and `/var/www/html/storage` **automatically sync or be stored directly on S3**.
- Support all file operations: uploads, reads, deletes, logs, cache, sessions, media, etc.

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Do **not** change `config/filesystems.php` to use `s3` driver for `local` or `public` disks. That *would* require code changes.
- ❌ Do **not** rewrite your application logic to use `Storage::disk('s3')`.

---

## ✅ What TO Do: Use a **Filesystem Bridge / FUSE Mount**

You will use a tool that **mounts your S3 bucket as a local directory** inside your Docker container. Your Laravel app will think it’s writing to a normal local folder, but it’s actually reading/writing to S3.

The best tool for this is **[s3fs-fuse](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)**.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation in Docker Swarm

### 1. ✅ Choose Your S3-Compatible Provider

You mentioned “another cloud host provider”. As long as they provide an **S3-compatible API** (which 99% do — like DigitalOcean Spaces, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, MinIO, etc.), you’re good.

You’ll need:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `S3_ENDPOINT` (e.g., `https://fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com`)
- `BUCKET_NAME`

---

### 2. ✅ Create a Custom Docker Image (or Modify Existing)

You need to install `s3fs` in your Laravel Docker image.

#### Example `Dockerfile` snippet (add to your existing image):

```dockerfile
# Install s3fs-fuse
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    s3fs \
    fuse \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Allow non-root users to use fuse (important for www-data)
RUN chmod 666 /dev/fuse

# Create mount points
RUN mkdir -p /mnt/s3/public /mnt/s3/storage

# Optional: Add a script to mount S3 on container start
COPY docker/entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
```

---

### 3. ✅ Create an Entrypoint Script

This script will mount the S3 buckets to `/mnt/s3/public` and `/mnt/s3/storage`, then bind-mount or symlink them to your Laravel directories **before starting PHP-FPM or Apache**.

#### File: `docker/entrypoint.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

echo "Mounting S3 buckets..."

# Ensure credentials file exists
mkdir -p ~/.aws
cat > ~/.aws/credentials <<EOF
[default]
aws_access_key_id = $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
EOF

# Mount public directory
if ! mountpoint -q /mnt/s3/public; then
    s3fs $BUCKET_NAME-public /mnt/s3/public \
        -o url=$S3_ENDPOINT \
        -o use_path_request_style \
        -o allow_other \
        -o uid=$(id -u www-data) \
        -o gid=$(id -g www-data) \
        -o umask=000 \
        -o mp_umask=000 \
        -o ensure_diskfree=1024
fi

# Mount storage directory
if ! mountpoint -q /mnt/s3/storage; then
    s3fs $BUCKET_NAME-storage /mnt/s3/storage \
        -o url=$S3_ENDPOINT \
        -o use_path_request_style \
        -o allow_other \
        -o uid=$(id -u www-data) \
        -o gid=$(id -g www-data) \
        -o umask=000 \
        -o mp_umask=000 \
        -o ensure_diskfree=1024
fi

echo "Creating symlinks..."

# Remove existing storage and public folders if they exist (optional, be careful!)
# rm -rf /var/www/html/storage /var/www/html/public

# Create symlinks (or you can use bind mounts — see below)
ln -snf /mnt/s3/storage /var/www/html/storage
ln -snf /mnt/s3/public /var/www/html/public

echo "S3 mounts ready."

# Start your app (e.g., PHP-FPM, Apache, etc.)
exec "$@"
```

> 💡 **Note**: You can also use `mount --bind` instead of symlinks if you prefer. Symlinks are simpler and work fine in 99% of cases.

### 4. ✅ Update Your Docker Compose / Swarm Stack

Add the required environment variables and ensure the container runs with `privileged: true` or at least `cap_add: [SYS_ADMIN]` and `devices: ["/dev/fuse"]`.

#### Example `docker-compose.yml` snippet:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  laravel-app:
    image: your-custom-laravel-image:latest
    environment:
      - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
      - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
      - S3_ENDPOINT=https://your-provider-endpoint.com
      - BUCKET_NAME=your-app-bucket
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse
    security_opt:
      - apparmor:unconfined
    volumes:
      - ./docker/entrypoint.sh:/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
    # ... rest of your config (ports, networks, etc.)
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: The `cap_add` and `devices` are **required** for `s3fs` to work inside the container.

---

### 5. ✅ (Optional) Pre-warm / Sync Existing Data

If you have existing files in `storage/` or `public/`, you should **sync them to S3** before deploying this setup, or your app will start with empty directories.

Use `awscli` or `s3cmd`:

```bash
aws s3 sync ./storage s3://your-app-bucket-storage/
aws s3 sync ./public s3://your-app-bucket-public/
```

---

### 6. ✅ Deploy and Test

Deploy your stack:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml your-stack
```

Test by:
- Uploading a user avatar.
- Checking if it appears in your S3 bucket.
- Checking Laravel logs (`storage/logs`) — they should appear in S3.
- Placing an order or claim — the files should be saved to S3.

---

## 🎯 Why This Works Without Code Changes

- Your Laravel app writes to `/var/www/html/storage/app/public/avatar.jpg` → which is a **symlink** → `/mnt/s3/storage/app/public/avatar.jpg` → which is an **S3 mount point** → file is stored in S3.
- All `file_get_contents`, `Storage::disk('local')`, `public_path()`, `storage_path()` calls work exactly as before — because the filesystem is transparently bridged.

---

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

1. **Performance**: S3 is not a real filesystem. Operations like `scandir`, `file_exists`, or heavy `unlink` can be slower. For logs or cache, consider keeping them local or using Redis/Memcached.
2. **Atomicity**: S3 does not support true atomic file operations. If your app relies on file locking, test thoroughly.
3. **Permissions**: Ensure `www-data` user has correct UID/GID in container to own the mounted files.
4. **Multi-container**: If you scale to multiple containers, **all will share the same S3 files** — which is usually what you want!

---

## ✅ Bonus: Keep Logs Local (Recommended)

To avoid S3 latency for logs, you might want to keep `storage/logs` local. You can do this by **mounting only subdirectories**:

```bash
# In entrypoint.sh, mount specific dirs:
s3fs $BUCKET_NAME-uploads /mnt/s3/storage/app/public ...
s3fs $BUCKET_NAME-media /mnt/s3/public/media ...

# Then symlink only those:
ln -snf /mnt/s3/storage/app/public /var/www/html/storage/app/public
ln -snf /mnt/s3/public/media /var/www/html/public/media
```

And leave `storage/logs`, `storage/framework/cache`, `storage/framework/sessions`, `storage/framework/views` on local disk (via Docker volume).

---

## ✅ Final Answer

> **Yes, you can seamlessly replace your `public/` and `storage/` directories with S3 without changing a single line of Laravel code by using `s3fs-fuse` to mount S3 buckets as local directories inside your Docker containers. Configure your Docker Swarm service with the proper capabilities and environment variables, and use an entrypoint script to establish the mounts and symlinks at container startup.**

This approach is battle-tested, scalable, and requires zero application refactoring.
