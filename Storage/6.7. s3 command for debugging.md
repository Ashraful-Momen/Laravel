Excellent! The bucket creation worked perfectly and now your S3 connection is fully functional with "Content match: Yes" and "S3 read/write test passed!". 

Now let's sync your files to S3:

## STEP 1: Sync Public Files to S3

```bash
php artisan storage:sync-s3 --public --skip-check
```

This should now upload all your 7059 public files successfully.

## STEP 2: Create Some Storage Files and Sync

```bash
# Create test files in storage
mkdir -p storage/app/public/test-uploads
echo "Test storage file" > storage/app/public/test-file.txt
cp public/Cattle_cow_images/101.png storage/app/public/test-uploads/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Image copy skipped"

# Sync storage files
php artisan storage:sync-s3 --storage --skip-check
```

## STEP 3: Test File Access

Test if your files are now accessible via S3:

```bash
# Test direct S3 URLs
curl -I https://s3.brilliant.com.bd/instasure/public/1.php
curl -I https://s3.brilliant.com.bd/instasure/storage/test-file.txt
```

## STEP 4: Test Through Your Website

Visit your website and check if static files load:
- `http://36.255.69.72:8080` (main site)
- `http://36.255.69.72:8080/storage/test-file.txt` (storage file)

## STEP 5: Verify Files in S3

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// List files in S3 to confirm upload
$files = Storage::disk('s3')->files('public');
echo "Public files count: " . count($files) . "\n";

$storageFiles = Storage::disk('s3')->files('storage');
echo "Storage files count: " . count($storageFiles) . "\n";

// Test a specific file
$exists = Storage::disk('s3')->exists('public/1.php');
echo "File exists: " . ($exists ? 'Yes' : 'No') . "\n";

exit
```

Your S3 integration is now working! The files should upload successfully and be accessible through both your website and direct S3 URLs.
